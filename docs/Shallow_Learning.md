###Shallow Learning

Add documentation about Shallow Learning approaches



###Logistic Regression

The logistic regression approach is similiar to the Feed Forward Neural Network without the hidden layer. 


###Naive Bayes Algorithm

Implement naive bayes algorithm


###Support Vector Machines

We fitted a support vector machine with a polynomial kernel. For completeness, we added functionality for grid search (GridSearchCV) which fits the support vector machine with multiple different hyperparameters. (Note about the grid search, it is an exhaustive execution that will take a lot of time and energy. We recommend enabling GPU support, however it is unclear whether or not performance will ampify as much as it would for deep learning. Do not be surprised by long computation time. A quicker alternative would be to manually tune the hyperparameters with a training and validation set). 


###Random Forests 

Random Forests are cool.
