### Machine Learning 

We are using machine learning for schedulability analysis to see whether there are patterns in the data that indicates future behavior. We are using *[Deep Learning](Deep_Learning.md)* and *[Shallow_Learning](Shallow_Learning.md)* to compare the approaches. It is easy to throw Deep Learning at the problem and expect it to work. However, to get a more complete analysis, it is important to investigate as many viable choices as we can get. Furthermore, different data-mining models can reveal different information about the data that we can use to fit our pre-trained model more. 

We are testing multiple approaches for both the deep and shallow learning approach.
