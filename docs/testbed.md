# MaLSAMi project testbed

The MaLSAMi project testbed consists basically two parts.
The data generation and task evaluation part and the test case setup, which is further divided.

The first part, data generation and task evaluation is well described in the [MaLSAMi concept](/concept). The second part, the test case setup is mainly copied from the Argos Research project](https://argos-research.github.io/documentation/) and further fitted to the projects needs.
