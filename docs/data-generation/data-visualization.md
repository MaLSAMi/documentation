# Data Visualizations


To get an idea of how the data is distributed, we displayed the data and its hyperparameters using different visualization plots:


Here is an example of the first ten lines of the Task Table

Each task has a "Number_of_Jobs". Although the number of jobs is used as a parameter in the learning process, the tasks that are being deplayed all consists of Jobs. These Jobs are represented in the table below
