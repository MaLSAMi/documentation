###Deep Learning

An implementation for a basic Feed Forward Network already exists. The repo and expansive documentation is provided *here*. 
The Feed Forward Network is a three layer (including input and output layers) network which uses a leaky-relu as its hidden unit activation function. On this trained network, the accuracy and precision rate was roughly ~80%. 

###Feed Forward Neural Network (FFN)

This network was relatively the same as the one that was implemented in the bachelor's thesis. The hyperparameter's were tuned moderately to better fit the data. However, since the data was fairly similiar to what was used to train this model earlier, it was not adjusted much as the error rate does not change significantly. 

It uses $x$ number of input neurons. 

It uses $1$ output neuron. (Binary classifier)

###Convolutional Neural Networks.

This network is similiar to the feed forward neural network with the exception of the added convolution and max pooling layers. 

###Spiking Neural Networks 

As spiking neural networks are just FFN with spiking capabilities, this is also similiar.
