###Deep Learning

The prototype was the Feed Forward Network and the other more specialized networks were built similiarly to the original FFN design. Therefore, the hyperparameters such as the number of input neurons, activation functions, and number of hidden layers were all kept relatively the same. You can find the source code for the feed forward network here. 

###Feed Forward Neural Network (FFN)

This network uses a leaky-relu for its hidden layer activation.

It uses $x$ number of input neurons. 

###Convolutional Neural Networks.

This network is similiar to the feed forward neural network with the exception of the added convolution and max pooling layers. 

###Spiking Neural Networks 

As spiking neural networks are just FFN with spiking capabilities, this is also similiar.
