# MaLSAMi project concept


As the MaLSAMi project wants to train machine learning algorithms for schedulability analysis, it needs task data to do so.

This task data is (in the scope of the project) artifical, which means it is generated from artifical tasks that execute arbitrary operations.

These tasks are first generated within tasksets and then distributed to either KVM/QEMU driven virtual machines, to real hardware or to ARM Servers where the system is virtualized.
